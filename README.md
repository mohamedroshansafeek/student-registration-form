 **To-Do List Web App â€“ Project Description**

I successfully completed a To-Do List web application as part of my weekly project using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application features a simple and user-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and modern styling.

Key functionalities include:

* Add new tasks** dynamically.
* Delete tasks** from the list.
* Optionally, store tasks using **local storage** (if implemented).

The goal of this project was to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design. It helped me strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals and improve my front-end development skills using Tailwind CSS for styling.
